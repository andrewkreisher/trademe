To get most of the features of the website to work on your own, you need to have a MongoDB shell open with the following: 

A directory named "tmdata" 

Within that directory, 3 collections named "items", "offers", and "users". 

To do this inside MongoDB once open, all you have to do is enter the following: 

> use tmdata
> db.createCollection("items")
> db.createCollection("offers")
> db.createCollection("users")
