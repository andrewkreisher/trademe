# TradeMe
This is my final project for the Stanford SPCS program for the Web Technology course. Created by Andrew Kreisher. All was made in less than 3 weeks using javascript, HTML, CSS, Jade, MongoDB and node.Js. This project is a website where users can register, log in, list items and trade in exchange for them. 

**Important:**
If you want to test the websites functionality (register, login, list, offer, etc.) please look at the dbSchema document for the database Schema used in MongoDB.
