# TradeMe
This is my final project for the Stanford SPCS program for the Web Technology course. Created by Andrew Kreisher. All was made in less than 3 weeks using javascript, HTML, CSS, Jade, MongoDB and node.Js. This project is a website where users can register, log in, list items and trade in exchange for them.
